# Installation / Configuration Kongfig

[Kongfig](https://github.com/mybuilder/kongfig) is a tool for Kong to allow declarative configuration. In XpaRestDemo project we use this until we have a Magic module/component to configure services and routs for our APIs dynamically.  

Kongfig is a node module which requires you to have nodejs installed. If thats the case you can install Kongfig (globally) with following command:
> npm install -g kongfig
